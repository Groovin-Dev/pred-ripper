# Pred Ripper

This is a pretty basic way of scraping the Predecessor API for matches. I think it works perfectly but I'm not gonna wait a day to see.

# Usage

1. Install Rust
2. Clone this repo
3. `cargo run --release`

# Output

The output will be 2 things:

1. A folder called matches with a bunch of json files in it. Each file is 10 matches.
2. A zip file called matches.zip. This is all the matches in one zip file.
